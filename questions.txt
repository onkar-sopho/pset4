0.  How many different colors does each format support?

=>      BMP: 32 bits per pixel, 4 billion colors
	    GIF: 8 bits per pixel, 256 colors
	    JPEG: 24 bits per pixel, 16 million colors
        PNG: 24 bit per pixel, 16 million colors

1.  Which of the formats supports animation?  
   
=>      GIF

2.  What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
  
=>      Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not,
        in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when 
        the file is uncompressed. With lossless compression, every single bit 
        of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is 
        uncompressed. All of the information is completely restored. 
        
        On the other hand, lossy compression reduces a file by permanently
        eliminating certain information, especially redundant information. 
        When the file is uncompressed, only a part of the original information
        is still there.

3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?

=>      JPEG
        
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?

=>      The system modifies the filename's first character to signal that it has
        been deleted. The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list
        of free clusters.

5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
       
=>      Write random characters to every address on the disk. There's consensus
        that "overwriting a disk with a few random passes" is sufficient.

6.  What’s stdint.h?

=>      stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library to allow programmers to write more portable code
        by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros
        
7.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

=>      Using these types allows us to write implementation- and plattform-independent code.
        So using this we can fill up exactly the amount of space we want in a file which is good
        for things like bitmap headers.

8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

=>      BYTE  : 1
        DWORD : 4
        LONG  : 4
        WORD  : 2

9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"

=>      The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" then the
        character "M" in ASCII encoding. The header field used to identify the BMP
        file is 0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal, same as BM in ASCII. This value is stored in "bfType".

10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

=>      bfSize describes the entire file size in bytes, whereas biSize is the
        size of BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes.
 
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

=>      If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin
        is the upper-left corner.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

=>      biBitCount.

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?

=>      fopen will return null if it cannot open the file. This can happen if there is not enough
        memory or the file cannot be found or if the user running the copy programm has no write
        permission for the directory he/she wants to copy the file to.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

=>      The third argument determines the number of elements fread will read. So this argument is
        always 1 because we are always reading struct so we only need 1 struct.  We want to copy one individual structure per read

15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

=>      The padding will be 3.
        
16. What does fseek do?

=>      The fseek() function is used to set the file position
        indicator for the stream to a new position

17. What is SEEK_CUR?

=>      SEEK_CUR is an option used in fseek to set the offset relative to
        the current pointer position.

18. Whodunit ?

=>      Rick Astley
